# Cardboard Box Step by Step Instructions

![003](../method/cardboard_box/cardboard_box_on_side/textures/003.png)  

Let's say we choose the cardboard box method.

There are many ways to utilize the cardboard box.

If we keep the box the way it is, it is kind of weak.

But, we can always duct tape the joints to make a stronger top.

But in general, if we instead close the box and seal it on all sides and then we CUT a hole that is a rectangle at the bottom of the box, then we can have access to the bowl we place there.

The Bowl should be a 10" circumference 6" deep plastic bowl.

These bowls cost around 50 cents or so.

By cutting the access door into the bottom of the box, on the side of the box, we enable easy access to changing the nutrient bowl.

Because the box is sealed, it is very strong and the plant that we place at the top of the box will now have much more support.

There are many ways to start the plants.

What we are doing with the CATopalian method is avoiding having to use 4 gallons of water in our nutrient buckets.

Instead of buckets, we use small bowls.

Thus, we must train the roots to be about 10" first, before they can enter the box.

Or you would just put books under the bowl to raise it higher to meet the short roots and then remove books as the plant grows.

But, what is very easy is to start the plants in a yogurt container.

When the plants have roots that are about 10" you can move them into the cardboard box set up.

This way the roots will think they have tons of space.

The truth is they do have lots of space.

We have utilzied space and minimized the amount of water needed!

The bowl of nutrients is very easy to make.

Start slow with 1:100 solution.

When we make our nutrient solution, we always add the same amount.

Depending on how fast your plants are drinking the nitrogen, will be one determining factor on how often to change the bowls water.

If you don't change the bowls water and instead just add more fertilizer every 5 days eventually the bowl will get dirty and the roots will suffer.

Therefore, it is better to change the bowls on schedule to avoid any issues at all!

Let's say that every 5 days for now, to be safe, you change the nutrient solution.

Each time you do it you weight out exactly the amount you will use for each thing using a scale.

Make sure you have a kitchen scale that has multiple zeros after the decimal point for better accuracy.

Each time you change the bowl, you will be putting the same amount in.

Thus, the plants will never have accumulation shock!

This is very important!

While it might seem like more work to change the bowl often, it prevents any issues!

NO issues means a good crop!

Happy Gardening :-)
