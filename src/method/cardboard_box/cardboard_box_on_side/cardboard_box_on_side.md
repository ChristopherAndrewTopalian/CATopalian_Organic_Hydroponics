# Cardboard Box on Side
A small home depot cardboard box on its side is very tall and blocks all light. On the floor where one side sits, we place our gallon jug of water and organic solution.

The plant we put on top where the box handle is and the roots descend into the gallon container that is on the floor in the box.

---

Now, importantly, we start the plant in a smaller container first, to train the roots to be about 10" long and would already have air roots developed.

---

The idea of usin the cardboard box is that it will trick the roots into thinking that the space is massive, so it will grow very large.

---

We can place a bigger container of water and organic solution on the bottom instead of a gallon jug. 

---

The organic nutrient solution is very easy:
1:100 ration of urine to water.
