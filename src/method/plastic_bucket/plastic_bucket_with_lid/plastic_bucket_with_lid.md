# Plastic Bucket with Lid

With a 5 Gallon plastic bucket that has a lid, or a make shift lid out of cardboard, we can easily put organic nutrient solution that we keep in a 1 gallon jug or other wide and deep container inside of the 5 Gallon bucket.

We then place our plant on top of our buket cover hole or make shift cover that has a hole that allows the roots to descend.

The bucket should be black, but if not, we can wrap the bucket in a trashbag and tape it.

---

The idea is that the bucket gives the roots the impression that it is very spacious.

This will make many air roots.

On the bottom is our organic nutrient solution that can be in a bowl or any container that is wide and deep.

---

We start the plants first in a smaller container to train the roots to be about 10" before putting them in this 5 gallon bucket system.
