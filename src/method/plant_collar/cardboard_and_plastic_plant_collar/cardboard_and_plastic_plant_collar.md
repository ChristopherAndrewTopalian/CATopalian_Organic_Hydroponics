# Cardboard and Plastic Plant Collar
We cut a square of cardboard and CUT into it a slit half way.

We then pull the slit open very wide to ensure the stem will have plenty of room

The cardboard will not be holding up the plant, but instead the plastic.

We cut a square of plastic and CUT a slit into it.

We place the plant stem in the slit and then we TAPE the slit together.

In this way it is the plastic that is holding the stem up and when the stem grows it will have plenty of flexibility to do so with the plastic.

WE ARE NOT USING THE CARDBOARD TO HOLD THE PLANT STEM BECAUSE CARDBOARD IS TOO RIGID AND WOULD PREVENT THE PLANT FROM GROWING.
