# 1:500 Ratio
To give an idea of the ratio of how little amount of urine to water is being used, let's imagine we are filling a container the size of a 32 oz yogurt container that is half full.

1 eye dropper full of 1 ml of urine is a very small amount in that 16 oz of water, which is about 500 grams of water.

This is about 1:500 ratio.

If you add more it may cause the leafs to curl from nitrogen burn.

Remember that urine is very powerful plant fertilizer.
