# 1:100 Ratio
To give an idea of the ratio of how little amount of urine to water is being used, let's imagine we are filling container the size of a 32 oz yogurt container that is half full.

3 eye dropper full of 1 ml of urine is a very small amount in that 32 16 oz of water.

This is about 1:158 ratio, but I give room for people possibly adding more.
