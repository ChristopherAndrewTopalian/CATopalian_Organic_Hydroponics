# Urine Nutrient Solution

![Urine is Fertilizer for Plants](textures/008.png)  

Urine is natural organic fertilizer for plants.

# 1:75 Ratio
NPK = 0.16 - 0.027 - 0.04

---

# 1:50 Ratio
NPK = 0.24 - 0.04 - 0.06

---

# 1:5 Ratio
All plants are different. This ratio may burn some plants instantly! Be careful. Start with lower ratios first!
But, if we were shooting for a good npk, we would use the 1:5 ratio to achieve an npk of 2.4, 0.4, 0.6

1:5 ratio would be about 100ml (100 grams of urine) to 500ml (500 grams) of water.

---

# 1:100 Ratio
3.3ml to every 500g of water is npk of 0.12, 0.02, 0.03  

So in a 32 oz yogurt container, we would have 500g of water, which is about half of the container and we would use 3 eyedroppers full of urine plus .3 more.

# 1:500 Ratio is likely too weak for many plants
To give an idea of the ratio of how little amount of urine to water is being used, let's imagine we are filling a container the size of a 32 oz yogurt container that is half full.

1 eye dropper full of 1 ml of urine is a very small amount in that 16 oz of water, which is about 500 grams of water.

This is about 1:500 ratio.

If you add too much nitrogen it may cause the leafs to curl from nitrogen burn.

Remember that urine is very powerful plant fertilizer.
