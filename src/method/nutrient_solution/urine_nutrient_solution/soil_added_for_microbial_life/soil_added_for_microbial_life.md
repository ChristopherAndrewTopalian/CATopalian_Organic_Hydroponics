# Soil Added for Microbial Life

# üìò Urine Fertilizer Enhancement Using Soil Microbes

## üå± Purpose

To provide a scientifically-grounded overview of how the addition of **soil to a 1:25 urine-to-water ratio** can accelerate nitrogen availability and nutrient cycling, turning diluted urine into a fast-acting organic fertilizer suitable for hydroponics and soil growing, even in low-tech or emergency environments.

## üß™ Background

When human urine is diluted in water (typically 1:20 to 1:30), it becomes a potential fertilizer rich in **urea (nitrogen source)**, **potassium**, and **phosphorus**. However:

* **Urea** must first be **converted into ammonium (NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫)**, then optionally into **nitrate (NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª)** for optimal plant uptake.
* This conversion does **not occur efficiently in plain water**, even well water. It requires **microbial activity**.

Microbes found in **healthy, biologically active soil** contain enzymes like **urease** that accelerate this process.

## üî¨ Experimental Setup

### Materials:

* 860g water (equivalent to 860mL)
* 34.4g urine (1:25 dilution)
* 1 to 3 teaspoons (5 to 15g) of **live soil** (preferably from a compost-rich or natural source)

### Optional:

* EC (Electrical Conductivity) or Nitrate Test Strips (for monitoring)

## üïí Timeline & Biological Transformations

| Time Since Mixing | Without Soil               | With Soil (Microbial Inoculation) | Notes                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0‚Äì24 hrs          | urea only (non-usable)     | urea begins conversion ‚Üí ammonium | Soil provides urease enzymes      |
| Day 2             | minor ammonium, no nitrate | ammonium increasing significantly | Plant can start uptake            |
| Day 3‚Äì5           | ammonium still low         | nitrate may begin forming         | Ideal for plant feeding           |
| Day 7+            | trace nitrate              | nitrate continues rising          | Nitrate is highly plant-available |

## üìä Nutrient Output Estimates (Per Liter, with Soil)

| Nutrient                  | Estimated PPM After 5 Days |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Nitrogen (as NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ + NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª) | 120‚Äì250 ppm                |
| Potassium (K)             | 150‚Äì200 ppm                |
| Phosphorus (P)            | 20‚Äì40 ppm                  |

> Note: Values are approximate and based on expected conversion pathways of urea using minimal soil inoculation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Is This Potassium Nitrate?

No ‚Äî this process results in **ammonium and nitrate ions**, but does **not isolate potassium nitrate (KNO‚ÇÉ)** unless urine has been passed through **soil columns** over **10+ days**, and the nitrate is separated by filtration. This table-top method produces:

* Potassium as K‚Å∫ ion (still present)
* Nitrogen as NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ and/or NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª (bioavailable)

But not chemically bound KNO‚ÇÉ unless further evaporation and isolation steps are taken.

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Soil-Activated Urine Fertilizer

* Immediate microbial conversion of urea (vs. waiting 3+ days without soil)
* Compatible with hydroponics and soil growing
* Allows **same-day plant feeding** with minimal nitrogen lag
* Requires only a teaspoon of soil per batch

---

## üì¶ Application Instructions

1. **Mix 860g of water** with **34.4g urine** (1:25 ratio)
2. **Add 1‚Äì3 tsp soil**, stir briefly
3. Let sit 12‚Äì24 hours for full microbial activation
4. Use as hydroponic nutrient or soil drench
5. Discard the bottom sludge layer if necessary to avoid root contact with soil in hydro setups

## üß† Closing Notes

This technique enables emergency and off-grid food production with:

* No external fertilizers
* No boiling
* No prolonged aging
* No sodium overload (as Na‚Å∫ binds to soil particles)

**Microbes are the missing ingredient.**
They turn waste into wealth ‚Äî and this method empowers that transformation with nothing more than a handful of soil.
