| Dilution Ratio         | 1:25.3                |
| Nutrient Change Cycle  | Every 5 days          |
| Additives Used         | None (No Epsom salt)  |
| Light Distance         | ~12 inches            |
| Light Intensity        | Low                   |

| Notes                  | No algae present due to prior light distance |

## Estimated Nutrients in Solution

| Nutrient       |   Estimated ppm | Notes                                  |
|:---------------|----------------:|:---------------------------------------|
| Nitrogen (N)   |             140 | critical for vegetative growth         |
| Phosphorus (P) |              30 | supports root development              |
| Potassium (K)  |             150 | essential for flowering and strength   |
| Sodium (Na)    |             120 | watch for leaf tip burn or necrosis    |
| Magnesium (Mg) |              15 | important for enzyme activation        |
| Sulfur (S)     |              20 | supports protein synthesis             |
| Calcium (Ca)   |              25 | important for cell walls and transport |

## Sodium Safety Warning

Sodium buildup is the primary long-term concern in urine-fed hydroponics. To avoid toxicity:

- **Flush the reservoir** every 5–7 days with fresh water.
- **Watch for signs** of sodium stress:
  - Leaf tips browning or drying
  - Crisp leaf edges or yellowing from outside in
  - Slowed or stunted growth despite green color

## Expected Plant Response

At 1:25 dilution:
- Lush green leaves, especially in new growth
- Strong vegetative response within 24–72 hours under proper lighting
- No observed nitrogen burn under 5-day cycle
- Potential sodium signs begin to show if left stagnant beyond 7 days

## Summary

The 1:25 dilution is a **high-end feeding ratio** for hydroponic cannabis, suitable for fast growers in vegetative stage when lighting and airflow are ideal. Sodium must be monitored, but growth response is expected to be strong.
