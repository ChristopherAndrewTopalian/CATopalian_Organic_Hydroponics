## Estimated Nutrients in Solution

| Nutrient       |   Estimated ppm | Notes                                  |
|:---------------|----------------:|:---------------------------------------|
| Nitrogen (N)   |             140 | critical for vegetative growth         |
| Phosphorus (P) |              30 | supports root development              |
| Potassium (K)  |             150 | essential for flowering and strength   |
| Sodium (Na)    |             120 | watch for leaf tip burn or necrosis    |
| Magnesium (Mg) |              15 | important for enzyme activation        |
| Sulfur (S)     |              20 | supports protein synthesis             |
| Calcium (Ca)   |              25 | important for cell walls and transport |

## Sodium Safety Warning

Sodium buildup is the primary long-term concern in urine-fed hydroponics. To avoid toxicity:

- **Flush the reservoir** every 5‚Äì7 days with fresh water.
- **Watch for signs** of sodium stress:
  - Leaf tips browning or drying
  - Crisp leaf edges or yellowing from outside in
  - Slowed or stunted growth despite green color

## Expected Plant Response

At 1:25 dilution:
- Lush green leaves, especially in new growth
- Strong vegetative response within 24‚Äì72 hours under proper lighting
- No observed nitrogen burn under 5-day cycle
- Potential sodium signs begin to show if left stagnant beyond 7 days

## Summary

The 1:25 dilution is a **high-end feeding ratio** for hydroponic plant, suitable for fast growers in vegetative stage when lighting and airflow are ideal. Sodium must be monitored, but growth response is expected to be strong.

# LIGHT

The plant is now receiving 25 times more light intensity than it was when the light was 5 feet away.

That's 2,500% more usable light energy, just by moving it closer.

### üìä Updated Nutrient Estimates (1:25 Ratio)

> These updated estimates improve upon the previous table using more refined nutrient concentration data per mL of human urine. They are more consistent with observed plant response and published scientific values. This update is especially important due to the proximity to **sodium toxicity thresholds**, which supports the conclusion that **1:25 is likely the upper limit** for safe urine dilution without flushing or active aeration.

| Nutrient     | Estimated PPM (1:25 Ratio) | Optimal Range (Hydroponic Plant) | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| **Nitrogen (N)**     | 306 ppm                    | 150‚Äì300 ppm (veg); 100‚Äì200 ppm (flower) | approaching veg-phase upper limit |
| **Phosphorus (P)**   | 37 ppm                     | 50‚Äì150 ppm                          | slightly under ideal, non-critical |
| **Potassium (K)**    | 400 ppm                    | 200‚Äì600 ppm                         | good for veg, usable in flower |
| **Magnesium (Mg)**   | 51 ppm                     | 50‚Äì70 ppm                           | right at target |
| **Sulfur (S)**       | 60 ppm                     | 60‚Äì150 ppm                          | on point |
| **Calcium (Ca)**     | 190 ppm                    | 150‚Äì250 ppm                         | excellent range |
| **Sodium (Na)**      | 46 ppm                     | <50 ppm                             | near the limit for hydro systems |

> ‚úÖ These numbers suggest **plant #3‚Äôs success at 1:30 ratio** was not a fluke. It was receiving ideal NPK support with sodium at safer margins.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **At 1:25**, sodium levels are borderline. Be vigilant for signs of sodium toxicity (chlorosis, leaf tip burn, leaf edge curling, poor growth).

# CONCLUSION:
After one day, the realization of how little Nitrogen is present in the water became very apparent!

Without bacteria present to convert the Urea to Ammonia there is very little useable nitrogen in the water!
Thus, the next series of experiments will have DIRT added for microbial life to process the Urea in the water to ammonia.
