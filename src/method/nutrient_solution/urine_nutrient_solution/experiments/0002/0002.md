# Experiment 0002

There is a third small seedling that had taken damage from transplanting it from soil.  
The seedling currently has no damage to leafs, no burns, and no leafs curling.

# Experiment Parameters
* 500 grams of Water
* 17 Grams of Urine
* 1:30 Ratio (rounded)  

---

We shall see if this ratio is perhaps too much, or maybe it will be just right and not cause any leaf or root issues.  

We will show chatgpt the photos daily of leafs and roots to ensure that things are going smoothly.
