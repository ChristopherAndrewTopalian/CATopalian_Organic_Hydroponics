# 🌱 Experiment 0002: Medium Strength Nutrient Trial (1:30 Ratio)

There is a **third small seedling** that had taken damage from transplanting it from soil.  
The seedling currently shows:
- ✅ No leaf damage  
- ✅ No burns  
- ✅ No curling

## 📊 Estimated Nutrient Profile (Fresh Human Urine @ 1:30)

| Element / Compound     | Estimated Amount in Solution | Plant Notes                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Nitrogen (N)**       | ~0.020% (200 ppm)            | Promotes leaf & stem growth               |
| **Phosphorus (P)**     | ~0.0033% (33 ppm)            | Root development & flowering              |
| **Potassium (K)**      | ~0.010% (100 ppm)            | Stress resistance, water regulation       |
| **Sodium (Na)**        | ~23–28 ppm                   | Too high causes salt stress               |
| **Magnesium (Mg)**     | Trace (low from urine)       | Needed for chlorophyll                    |
| **Sulfur (S)**         | Trace (low from urine)       | Enhances flavor, aroma, protein synth.    |
| **Calcium (Ca)**       | Trace                        | Needed for cell wall strength             |
| **pH Estimate**        | ~6.0 – 7.0 (fresh urine)     | Good for hydro, monitor drift over time   |
| **EC Estimate**        | ~0.3 – 0.4 mS/cm             | Safe, monitor for buildup over days       |

## 🔍 Observation Notes

We shall monitor this seedling **daily** and update:
- 📷 **Leaf appearance**
- 📷 **Root development**
- 🌡️ **Temperature & light conditions**
- 💧 **PPM & EC if available**

We will post photos here, and allow **ChatGPT** to assist in identifying any subtle signs of deficiency or excess.

This experiment will help determine whether a **1:30 ratio** can be used safely in early seedling stages **without added magnesium or sulfur (Epsom salt)**.

### 📦 Optional Additives (Not Used Yet)

| Compound     | Purpose                      | Notes                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Epsom Salt   | Adds Mg + S                  | Can be added if leaf yellowing occurs  |
| Wood Ash     | Potassium, Calcium, pH up    | Use cautiously, adds salts             |
| Bone Meal    | Adds P + Ca (slow release)   | Not hydro-soluble                      |

### 💭 Final Thoughts

This trial will help us better dial in safe nutrient levels using **low-cost, sustainable ingredients** like fresh urine. We seek:
- ✅ No leaf curl  
- ✅ No tip burn  
- ✅ Strong new leaf formation  
- ✅ Root expansion into hydro reservoir  

We are hopeful this will be the **"Goldilocks Ratio"** — not too strong, not too weak. 🍵🌿

Note: We did NOT add epsom salt to this seedling.  

# Day One:  
* No Burn
* No Curling
* Good Green Color
* So far, 1:30 appears safe.  

# Day Two:  
* No Burn
* No Curling
* Good Green Color
* So far, 1:30 appears safe.  
* Today I moved the light closer for the plants next light session. It had been previously 4 feet away, because it was on the high setting before and was causing high temperature issues, but I then turned it down and thus should have also lowered the light closer to the plants.
