# CATopalian Organic Hydroponics: 1-to-50 Urine Dilution Test (Hydroponic Cannabis)

## 🧪 Experiment Overview

We aim to determine the ideal ratio of fresh human urine in a small-scale hydroponic cannabis system, using only organic inputs. This setup explores a **1:50 urine-to-water ratio**, with a container holding **860 grams (≈860 mL) of water**, updated every **5 days**.

## 💧 Experiment Setup

| Parameter        | Value                  |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Water Volume     | 860 grams              |
| Urine Volume     | 17.2 grams (≈17.2 mL)  |
| Dilution Ratio   | 1:50 (Urine : Water)   |
| Cycle Duration   | 5 days (change water)  |
| Urine Type       | Fresh, not aged        |
| Additives        | 2 g Epsom salt (MgSO₄)  |

## 🌱 Nutrient Estimates at 1:50 Ratio

| Nutrient     | Est. % in Fresh Urine | ppm Delivered | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Nitrogen (N) | 0.6–1.0%               | ~200 ppm      | From urea, slow-release |
| Phosphorus (P) | ~0.1%                | ~20 ppm       | Safe low dose |
| Potassium (K) | ~0.3%                 | ~60 ppm       | Good boost |
| Sodium (Na)   | ~0.25%                | ~50 ppm       | Within safe hydro limits |
| Magnesium (Mg) | —                    | ~60 ppm¹     | From Epsom salt |
| Sulfur (S)     | —                    | ~230 ppm¹     | From Epsom salt |

¹ Based on 2 grams Epsom salt in 860g water.

## 📉 Sodium & Salt Safety

Fresh urine contains ~2.5g/L sodium. At 1:50:

- Total sodium added: **~43 mg**
- Final sodium concentration: **~50 ppm**
- **Well below hydroponic risk thresholds (≤100 ppm = safe)**

---

## 🔁 Water Change Timing

- **Water should be changed every 5 days**
- Prevents urea from converting to ammonia
- Keeps nitrogen at stable, non-burning levels
- Prevents salt buildup

---

## 🔥 Expected Plant Response

| Stage      | Expectation                          |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Seedling   | Gentle growth, no burn                |
| Vegetative| Sufficient nitrogen, mild growth      |
| Flowering  | Will require phosphorus supplement    |

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Future Enhancements

- **Aged urine** can increase nitrogen to >2%, but risks burning in hydro systems and smells heavily of ammonia.
- Consider tracking EC and PPM with a meter.
- For budding/flowering stage, **bone meal or wood ash extract** may be needed to boost phosphorus and calcium.

---

## 📌 Summary

- This system uses **only urine and Epsom salt**
- Nutrients delivered are **safe and balanced**
- Can be scaled up or tested with different ratios
- Excellent for **emergency/off-grid growing**

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "If we can grow food and medicine using only what flows from the human body, the fire from wood, and the minerals beneath our feet, we become sovereign again — beyond war, beyond currency, beyond corporations."

# Day One
* No signs of burn
* No signs of leaf curling
* Today I increased the air root space to be about 2-3".
* Keeping the nutrient solution the same today.
* Added Boxes over the plants for their NIGHT TIME. This is the first time they have received total dark.  

---

# Day Two
* No signs of burning
* No signs of curling  

1:45 ratio appears to be safe.
