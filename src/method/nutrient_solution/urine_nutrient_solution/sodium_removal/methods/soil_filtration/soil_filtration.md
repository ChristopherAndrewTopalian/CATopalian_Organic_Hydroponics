# Soil Filtration

## Soil is Negatively Charged
## Sodium is Positively Charged

When we pour urine into soil, much of the sodium in the urine will end up staying in the soil, due to electrostatic charges.

Thus, when we have a yogrut container that is 32 oz and has many 1/8" holes at the bottom and we fill it to the top with dirt and then pour urine in at 300 grams, about 55 grams will end up in the bottom container that consists of reduced sodium urine.  

This reduced sodium urine can be used in our hydroponics.  

But the issue remains that we are still utilizing AMMONIA for the fertilizer, which is NOT as good for plants as POTASSIUM NITRATE.  

So, keep in mind that while the soil filtration will reduce the sodium, it will not result in potassium nitrate.  

To make potassium nitrate we must use SOIL MICROBE PROCESSING instead.  

PLANTS WANT POTASSIUM NITRATE!

* Container with many 1/8" holes in the bottom 
* Soil in the container
* Another container underneath catches what comes out.  
* Pour Urine into the soil
* The soil filters out much of the sodium
* The reduced-sodium-urine falls into the container we have underneath.  

Soil is negatively charged while sodium is positively charged and thus they cling to each other.  

In this way we don't have to wait very long at all for the urine to be useable for our hydroponic systems.

In addition we are adding microbes to the solution, because the urine passing through the dirt makes some of the dirt end up in the solution below.  

This means that more microbes will convert the Urea into Ammonia.  

Keep in mind that this technique of SOIL FILTERING results in ammonia instead of potassium nitrate and thus is NOT as healthy for plants!  

The reduced sodium urine is a nutrient method that is using AMMONIA for the nitrogen, but the plants do NOT like that form as much as Potassium Nitriate that we get from SOIL MICROBE PROCESSING, which takes baout 10 days or more to process.
