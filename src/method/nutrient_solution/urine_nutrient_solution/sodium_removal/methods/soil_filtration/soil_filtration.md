# Soil Filtration

## Soil is Negatively Charged
## Sodium is Positively Charged

When we pour urine into soil, much of the sodium in the urine will end up staying in the soil, due to electrostatic charges.

Thus, when we have a yogrut container that is 32 oz and has many 1/8" holes at the bottom and we fill it to the top with dirt and then pour urine in at 300 grams, about 55 grams will end up in the bottom container that consists of reduced sodium urine.  

This reduced sodium urine can be used in our hydroponics.  

But the issue remains that we are still utilizing AMMONIA for the fertilizer, which is NOT as good for plants as POTASSIUM NITRATE.  

So, keep in mind that while the soil filtration will reduce the sodium, it will not result in potassium nitrate.  

To make potassium nitrate we must use SOIL MICROBE PROCESSING instead.  

PLANTS WANT POTASSIUM NITRATE!
