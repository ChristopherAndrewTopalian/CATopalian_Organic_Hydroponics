# DIY Soil Column Bucket for Potassium Nitrate Fertilizer

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to build a high-efficiency soil column system to produce **low-sodium, high-nitrate fertilizer** using **human urine and microbial soil conversion**. This system is designed for resilience and usability‚Äîeven in post-disaster or off-grid conditions.

We‚Äôll walk through:

* Materials list
* Step-by-step bucket construction
* System assembly
* Usage guidelines
* Tips for phosphorus supplementation

## üå± Materials Required

| Item                      | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 2 x 5-gallon buckets      | One for soil column, one for drainage catch |
| Power drill               | With 3/8" bit                               |
| Soil                      | Preferably rich in microbial life           |
| Urine                     | Fresh human urine (daily)                   |
| Water                     | Clean water (well, snow, rain okay)         |
| Mesh or screen (optional) | To cover drain holes inside bucket          |
| Concrete blocks           | To elevate soil column                      |
| Catch basin               | Bowl or container for runoff                |

## üõ† Step-by-Step Construction

### 1. Prepare the Drain Bucket

* Use **one clean 5-gallon bucket** to catch the filtered nutrient solution.
* No drilling is needed for this one.

### 2. Drill Drain Holes in Soil Column Bucket

* Take your **second 5-gallon bucket**.
* Drill **at least 7‚Äì10 evenly spaced holes** in the bottom using a **3/8" drill bit**.
* You may also drill **2‚Äì3 extra holes around the lower sides** to assist draining.
* (Optional) Place a small screen or mesh at the bottom inside the bucket to prevent soil from leaking out.

### 3. Fill the Soil Bucket

* Fill bucket with **about 4.5 gallons of soil**, leaving **2‚Äì3 inches at the top**.
* Use **microbe-rich garden soil**, preferably not sterile or peat-only.

## üß™ System Use Instructions

### Day 0‚Äì10: Urine Inoculation Phase

* Pour about **500 mL (half a yogurt container)** of urine per day into the top of the soil bucket.
* Do **not** add water during this phase.
* Microbes begin converting **urea ‚Üí ammonia ‚Üí nitrite ‚Üí nitrate**.

### Day 11‚Äì15: Wait Phase
* Allow the microbes to do their work.

### Day 16: Flush Phase
* Pour **1000‚Äì1500 mL (approx. 2‚Äì3 bottles)** of clean water through the column.
* Let water fully drain through into the catch basin below.
* Collect and store runoff in clean bottles. This is your **potassium nitrate fertilizer solution**.

## üìä Nutrient Profile Estimate (Post-Flush)

| Nutrient      | Estimate (ppm) |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Nitrogen (N)  | 250‚Äì400        |
| Potassium (K) | 150‚Äì300        |
| Sodium (Na)   | \~10‚Äì50        |
| Phosphorus    | Very low       |

> Note: These values vary with soil type, urine concentration, microbe density, and time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Phosphorus, Magnesium & Calcium

This system is high in N & K, but low in:

* **Phosphorus (P)** ‚Üí Add **bone meal** (2‚Äì4g per liter of solution)
* **Magnesium & Sulfur** ‚Üí Add **Epsom salt** (1‚Äì2g per liter of solution)
* **Calcium** ‚Üí Optional: Add finely crushed **eggshell powder** or gypsum

---

## üß† Tips & Safety Notes

* **Fume safety**: Outdoors is best; indoors may lead to ammonia odor.
* **Evaporation**: Placing runoff in the sun will **concentrate NPK**, but sodium remains.
* **Column reuse**: Soil can be reused after letting it dry out or resting it for \~7 days.
* **Snowmelt or rainwater**: Ideal for flush phase‚Äîsodium-free and sustainable.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This two-bucket system transforms human urine into a **clean, low-sodium, organic nitrate fertilizer** using only soil and time. It‚Äôs suitable for:

* Hydroponics (diluted)
* Soil-grown vegetables
* Emergency food systems

Now farmers and home growers can produce potassium nitrate safely without relying on imports, industrial ammonia, or expensive fertilizer bags.  

Friends: Listen: The Super Volcanoes will go off and crops will fail. The Ice Age begins very fast. Make sure that you learn how to farm hydroponically using urine because it is one of the things that all humans will have access to in the event of an ice age and total industrial agricultural crop failure world wide!
