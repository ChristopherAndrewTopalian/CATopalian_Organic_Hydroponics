# Soil Microbe Processing - F

## 🪣 FILLING THE BUCKET — Soil Level

**Fill your 5-gallon bucket with soil to about 4 to 4.5 gallons full**, leaving:

* **2–4 inches of headroom** at the top for splash control and evaporation
* This gives about **15–17 inches of vertical filtration depth**

**Why?**

* This is deep enough for **nitrification to occur**
* Deep enough for **sodium ions to be retained** in the soil’s cation exchange sites
* But **not so deep** that your filtered extract takes forever to collect

---

## 🔃 Total Cycle Duration

* **Urination phase**: 7–10 days of daily inputs
* **Microbial processing lag time**: 2–5 more days depending on temperature, moisture, and soil life
* ✅ **Ideal Total Duration: 14–15 days** before you run fresh water through and collect nitrate-rich runoff

## 🧪 NPK of the Evaporated Runoff (Potassium Nitrate Crystals)

Based on known filtered nitrate leachate:

| Nutrient               | Estimate (ppm)  | NPK Equivalent |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **Nitrogen (as NO₃⁻)** | 1,000–1,400 ppm | \~10–14 (N)    |
| **Phosphorus**         | \~35–45 ppm     | \~0.1–0.2 (P)  |
| **Potassium**          | \~500–800 ppm   | \~5–8 (K)      |

🎯 **Evaporated form NPK estimate**: **\~10-0.2-7**
That's assuming full evaporation. It is **extremely concentrated**, and can burn plants if not diluted.

## 💥 Burn Risk in Hydroponics

Yes — **burning is possible if you don’t dilute this properly**.

### Guidelines:

| Plant Type       | Safe ppm for N | Burn Risk ppm |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Seedlings        | 100–150 ppm    | >200 ppm      |
| Vegetative phase | 200–400 ppm    | >600 ppm      |
| Flowering phase  | 300–500 ppm    | >700–800 ppm  |

Since your evaporated extract could exceed **1,000 ppm N**, **you MUST dilute it.**

---

## ✅ How to Use It Safely in Hydroponics

1. **Take your filtered runoff**
2. **Dilute 1 part into 10 to 20 parts clean water**
3. **Check pH and EC** (Electrical Conductivity = nutrient strength)
4. **Optional: Add Epsom salt** (1 g per 5 liters)

You can **start lower and gradually increase strength** as you monitor plant response.

## 🌿 Is Potassium Nitrate Safe for Plants?

**Yes, it's excellent for Plants.**
In fact, **most commercial plant growers use potassium nitrate** in flowering stages for:

* **Flower Buds swelling**
* **Strong stems**
* **Nitrogen support without excessive chlorophyll formation**

### Why it’s preferred:

* **Nitrate** form is immediately available
* **No salt buildup** like from ammonium or chloride forms
* **pH stable**
* Easy to **fine-tune dose**

---

## 💨 Evaporation and Residue: What to Expect

* If you **evaporate 1 liter** of filtered nitrate water, you’ll get:

  * \~**3–6 grams** of potassium nitrate crystals
  * Looks like **whitish mineral dust** or crystals (like salt but lighter)
  * Highly soluble in water
  * Store in a **dry jar** with label

☀️ **Evaporation time in sun**:

* **2–4 days** in strong sunlight (open shallow tray recommended)
* Faster in dry air, slower in humidity

## 🪴 Summary — Your Today Plan

✅ **Fill** 5-gallon bucket 4.5 gallons with soil
✅ **Drill** 4–8 holes at base (1/4" to 3/8" ideal)
✅ **Place** catch bucket underneath
✅ **Add urine daily** (1 yogurt container / day = 50–100 mL)
✅ **Wait 7–10 days** (add nothing after day 10)
✅ **Wait 4–5 more days** (microbial processing)
✅ **Pour water through** (500–1000 mL)
✅ **Catch leachate**
✅ **Evaporate for crystals or use as-is diluted in hydroponics**
