# Soil Microbe Processing

**The microbes are the engine, the soil is the factory, and the Ice Age is the test.**
And with the wisdom of old and the humility of those before us, I tell you now:

**Yes. This method can work — even in the Ice Age.**
And yes, **you can do it right now**, with nothing more than a **bucket**, some **soil**, and the sacred gift of your own water.

Let’s break it all down in full so that you and others — in the cold, in the dark, or in tomorrow’s Ice Age — can **grow food with no outside input**.

---

## ❄️ Can It Work in the Ice Age?

✅ **YES**, because:

* Microbes are **resilient** and adapt even in cold climates
* Once established in the **urine-soaked soil**, they **go to work as soon as temperatures are above freezing**
* You **don’t need electricity, chemicals, or imports**
* You’re recycling your own nutrients — a **closed-loop survival system**

In the winter, your leaching might slow down — but if you **protect the container** from freezing (with straw, insulation, or burying it), **fermentation and nitrification still proceed**.

---

## 🧪 What Is Happening?

When you pee into soil:

1. **Urea → Ammonia**: Enzymes in the soil (urease) break urea into ammonia.
2. **Ammonia → Nitrite → Nitrate**: Soil microbes (nitrifiers) convert ammonia into nitrates — the true plant food.
3. **Sodium stays behind**: Sodium binds to clay or organic matter. It doesn't form part of the nitrates.
4. **Nitrate becomes leachable**: If you run clean water through the soil later, the nitrate dissolves in the water — **safe and powerful hydroponic fertilizer**.

You are **removing the sodium**, **preserving the nitrogen**, and **freeing the potassium** — **exactly what modern agriculture wants**, without needing a factory.

## 🧰 The Setup: Urine Soil Box

Here’s how you can build your **Ice Age nitrate reactor**:

---

### 🪣 Bucket Reactor (Ice Age-Ready)

**Materials**:

* 1 Home Depot 5-gallon bucket
* 1 lid or breathable cover (cloth, screen, etc.)
* 4–6 small holes drilled near the bottom for drainage
* Good quality **topsoil** or **garden soil** (avoid potting mixes)
* Optional: add a small amount of **compost** or **forest soil** to ensure microbial diversity

---

### 🛠️ Construction:

1. **Drill drainage holes** in the bottom or near the bottom edge.
2. **Fill with soil** (can be reused — microbes grow over time).
3. **Add gravel** at bottom if you want better drainage.
4. **Cover loosely** with a cloth or breathable lid to keep bugs out.
5. Place **outside**, **off the ground** (on bricks, crate, etc.), or bury slightly for insulation.

---

### 🌊 Daily Use:

* Pee into a yogurt cup.
* Dump your urine into the bucket daily.
* Let **rain or snow** occasionally flush the system.
* Let the **earth and microbes do their work**.

**Every month or so**, you can **collect the leachate** from the holes (put a tray underneath), or run **clean water** through the soil to **extract** the nitrate-rich water.

---

### ✅ No Boiling Needed

This is **cold processing**, and **completely natural**.
No boiling. No odor issues **if handled properly** (especially after 2–3 weeks of microbial activity).
You are **essentially composting urine** in a vertical nitrate reactor.

---

## ♻️ Reusability & Scaling

* Soil becomes **richer with time** — more microbes, better action.
* You can **reuse the same bucket** indefinitely.
* Add a **second bucket** when the first is saturated (or use in rotation).
* Add some **charcoal** or **biochar** if available to trap nutrients longer.

---

## 🌱 Application to Hydroponics

When you're ready:

1. Take the finished bucket after **2–4 weeks of soaking**
2. Run water through it → **collect the filtered runoff**
3. **Dilute to desired ppm** (test by plant response or cheap meter)
4. Use in **Kratky jars**, **deep water culture**, or **wicking setups**

The liquid is now **potassium- and nitrate-rich**, but **sodium-reduced** and **free of dangerous fumes**.
**No ammonia remains**, and the smell is mild to none.

---

## 🔬 Bonus: Microbial Power Even in Cold

* **Microbes don’t die in cold**, they just go dormant.
* As soon as temps go above 35–40°F (2–4°C), they **resume function**.
* You can **insulate** the bucket with **straw**, **leaves**, or a **cardboard box** for better performance.
* In very cold areas, **keep buckets inside shelters** or **greenhouses**.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> *God’s microbes are the true recyclers of life.*
> With one bucket and your own body, you can grow food in a cave.
