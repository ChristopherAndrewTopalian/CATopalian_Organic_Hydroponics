### Small-Scale Fertilizer Maker for Evaporation or Direct Use

---

### 🧪 Purpose

To create a **compact system** that converts **urine to nitrate-rich, low-sodium plant fertilizer** using microbial action in soil — ideal for:

* Small spaces
* Indoor windows (with fan/ventilation)
* Daily micro-batches
* Lightweight prepping or Ice Age survival
* Teaching and scientific demonstrations

---

### 🧰 Materials

* 1 large **yogurt container** (750g or 1L)
* Pin or drill (⅛” or 3mm drill bit)
* **Rich soil** (preferably with humus and microbial life)
* Catch cup or saucer
* Optional: cheesecloth or fine mesh over drain holes
* Optional: coffee filter paper between soil layers to hold shape
* Optional: plastic wrap over top for evaporation/condensation capture

---

### 🔧 Construction Instructions

1. **Drill 3 to 5 holes** in the bottom for drainage.
2. **Fill the container** with soil to the top, lightly packed.
3. Let sit **outdoors or by a window** to ensure microbial survival.
4. Place a bowl or container underneath to catch leachate (runoff).

---

### 🧫 Daily Protocol

* Pour **250–500 mL urine** onto the soil daily.
* Do this **for 7 to 10 days** (longer = more concentrated).
* **Do not flush yet.** Allow microbes time to nitrify.

---

### Waiting Phase
* After the day 10, stop adding urine to the soil.  
* Allow the Microbes 5 days to do their work.  

### 💧 Flushing Phase
1. Pour **500–750 mL of clean water** through the container.
2. Catch the runoff. This is your **fertilizer leachate**.
3. Optional: **Repeat flush 2 more times** to get all usable nitrate.

🧪 This runoff is **nitrate-rich, low-sodium, and safe for hydroponics** or foliar spray.

### 🔥 Evaporation to Powder (Optional)

If you want to **store** the fertilizer as **crystals or powder**:

* Pour collected runoff into a glass tray or bowl.
* Leave in sun (or next to fire or wood stove).
* After 3–5 days (depending on humidity), you’ll see **white or yellowish crystals**.
* Scrape and store in a **dry, airtight jar**.

⛏ **Yield estimate**:
From 10 days of 500 mL/day:

* \~150–300 mL per flush
* 3 flushes = \~450–750 mL
* \~4–6 grams of **dried nitrate fertilizer** (mostly potassium nitrate)

> This is enough for **many hydroponic feedings** due to its strength.

### ⚗️ What About Sodium?

💡 Soil naturally **binds sodium** ions due to its negative charge, especially in **clay and humus-rich soils**.
Even in a yogurt container, most sodium will **cling to the soil particles** and **not pass into the runoff**, especially with the slow 10-day microbial soak.

---

### 🌿 Bonus: Add Bone Meal?

Yes — bone meal or Epsom salt can be added **after runoff is collected**:

* **Bone Meal**: 1–2 grams per liter for phosphorus
* **Epsom Salt**: 1 gram per liter for magnesium + sulfur

---

### 🏠 Indoor Use Warning

Even at small scale:

* There **will** be **ammonia fumes** for the first few days.
* Ensure **ventilation** or use it **outside** or in a shed.
* Use **baking soda in the catch tray** to neutralize smells if needed.

---

### 🔥 Final Notes

* This method **does not produce potassium nitrate crystals directly** unless:

  * You evaporate the nitrate-rich runoff water.
  * You allow full nitrification (10+ days feeding + 3 flushes).
* It will NOT reach full nitrate levels without enough time or soil volume.
* **Yield can be scaled up** by running multiple yogurt containers in parallel.
