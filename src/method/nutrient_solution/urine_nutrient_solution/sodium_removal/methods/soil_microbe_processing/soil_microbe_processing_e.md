# Soil Microbe Processing - E

## 🔥 EVAPORATION & CONCENTRATION

**Evaporating the soil-filtered runoff water** produces a **powerful, nitrate-rich concentrate**. Use sparingly.

---

## 📅 POST-URINE WAIT TIME

**Q: How long after the *last urine pour* should they wait before collecting water?**
⏳ **3 to 4 days**, ideally **5**, after the last urine pour.
This gives the soil microbes time to finish the nitrification chain (urea → ammonia → nitrite → nitrate).

➡️ After that final wait, **run clean water through** and collect the nitrate gold.

## 🧪 APPEARANCE & CONCENTRATION YIELD

**Q: What does it look like after evaporation?**
🌫️ It forms a **light beige or white crust or powder** at the bottom of the evaporation dish. If it's pure enough, it may look almost crystalline.

**Q: How much fertilizer does it yield?**
From \~1 liter of runoff (1,000 mL) → evaporation might give **4–10 grams** of nitrate-rich solids, depending on concentration.

If using yogurt cup–sized batches daily and collecting all runoff, you could realistically evaporate **100 mL per day** per yogurt container.

## BUCKET SETUP & SOIL LEVEL

**Q: How much soil to use in a 5-gallon bucket?**
Fill it to the top. Give microbes **maximum surface area and oxygen**. The more soil, the **longer it lasts** and the **more urine it can process daily**.

**Q: Will a yogurt cup of soil work?**
Yes, but only for small-scale testing.
Try:

* 1 yogurt container of soil
* 10 mL urine per day
* Run water after 10 days

It’s a **micro version** of the full bucket.

**Organic Plant Fertilizer from Urine 🌿**
No smell. No sodium. No chemicals.
* Drill holes in 5 gal bucket
* Fill with soil
* Add urine daily
* After 10 days, wait 5 more
* Run water through
* Collect the runoff.
* This water can be used immediately as plant fertilizer OR
* Let the water Evaporate if you want concentrated powder version.

High in nitrates. Safe for hydroponics.

**Ice Age Fertilizer ❄️🌱**
Turn urine into sodium-free nitrate fertilizer:

* Soil bucket
* Add urine daily
* Wait 5 days after last pour
* Flush w/ water
  💧 Runoff = nitrate gold
* Use the Water immediately on plants as fertilizer OR
* Let the water Evaporate if you want concentrated powder version.

  ✅ No boiling
  ✅ Hydroponics safe
  ✅ Saves lives

> *NPK levels from this method rival store fertilizer — but with zero sodium, zero cost, and full sustainability.*
