# Soil Filtration
### [Soil Filtration Method](methods/soil_filtration/soil_filtration.md)  

* Container with many 1/8" holes in the bottom 
* Soil in the container
* Another container underneath catches what comes out.  
* Pour Urine into the soil
* The soil filters out much of the sodium
* The reduced-sodium-urine falls into the container we have underneath.  

Soil is negatively charged while sodium is positively charged and thus they cling to each other.  

In this way we don't have to wait very long at all for the urine to be useable for our hydroponic systems.

In addition we are adding microbes to the solution, because the urine passing through the dirt makes some of the dirt end up in the solution below.  

This means that more microbes will convert the Urea into Ammonia.  

Keep in mind that this technique of SOIL FILTERING is still only utilizing the ammonia style of growing, instead of potassium nitrate and thus is still NOT as healthy for plants compared to if we created Potassium Nitrate using SOIL MICROBE PROCESSING!  

The reduced sodium urine is a nutrient method that is using AMMONIA for the nitrogen, but the plants do NOT like that form as much as Potassium Nitrate that we get from SOIL MICROBE PROCESSING, which takes about 10 days or more to process.

# Other ideas

## Farmers could run fresh urine through an ion exchange barrel, reduce sodium by 80 to 95% and collect the output as low sodium fertilizer.
