# Soil Filtration
* Container with many 1/8" holes in the bottom 
* Soil in the container
* Another container underneath catches what comes out.  
* Pour urine into the soil
* The soil filters out the sodium
* The reduced-sodium-urine falls into a container we have underneath.  

In this way we don't have to wait very long at all for the urine to be useable for our hydroponic systems.

In addition we are adding microbes to the solution, because the urine passing through the dirt makes some of the dirt end up in the solution below.  

Soil is negatively charged while sodium is positively charged and thus they cling to each other.

# Other ideas

## Farmers could run fresh urine through an ion exchange barrel, reduce sodium by 80 to 95% and collect the output as low sodium fertilizer.
