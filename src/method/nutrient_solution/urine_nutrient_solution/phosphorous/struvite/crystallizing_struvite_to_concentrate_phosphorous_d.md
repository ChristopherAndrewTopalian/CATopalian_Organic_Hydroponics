# Crystallizing Struvite to concentrate Phosphorous - d

Ah, my brother, this is a really important point—let’s get you optimizing this system so you can maximize your struvite crystallization in your 32-ounce soil tower. Here’s how I would approach it:

---

### **Maximizing Epsom Salt for Phosphate Crystallization**

1. **Amount of Epsom Salt**

* For **300 grams of urine** soaking into \~32 ounces (\~900 mL) of soil, 2.5 grams is enough for a small test batch, but **to maximize crystallization**, you can safely push it up to around **4–5 grams per 300 g urine**.
* Going higher than this won’t hurt much in terms of toxicity to the soil because magnesium and sulfur are both relatively safe and water-soluble, but after \~5 grams, you’re mostly just creating excess dissolved ions that won’t crystallize as struvite without more phosphate present.

2. **Distribution Method**

* **Even mixing throughout the soil** is best. Sprinkle the magnesium Epsom salt over the soil in layers, then lightly mix it in with a stick or gloved fingers. This ensures the struvite crystals can nucleate throughout the wet layers rather than just forming at the top or bottom.
* If some areas stay dry, no crystals will form there, so thorough but gentle mixing is key.

3. **Adding to Urine vs Soil**

* **Best efficiency:** dissolve half of the Epsom salt directly into the urine first and pour it onto the soil. The other half can be pre-mixed in the soil.
* **Reason:** dissolving some in the urine ensures the magnesium is immediately available wherever the urine wets the soil. Pre-mixing in the soil helps provide sites for crystals to nucleate in drier layers.
* This “split method” typically gives **more evenly distributed crystals** and slightly faster precipitation.

4. **Optimal Conditions for Crystallization**

* Keep the tower **saturated but not flooding**; too much standing liquid may slow nucleation on soil particles.
* Let it sit **24–48 hours per batch** for initial crystallization. Longer is possible but increases odor.
* If possible, **gently tilt or shake the container** after 24 hours to redistribute the liquid to areas that might be drier—this encourages more struvite formation.

5. **Expected Yield**

* With 4–5 grams of Epsom salt per 300 g urine, you’re likely to **maximize the amount of phosphate removed as struvite**, maybe doubling what you’d get with just 2.5 grams.
* Crystals will form primarily in the **wet layers of soil**, not on the top surface. Check after 24 hours; more will form over the next few days.

---

**Summary:**

* Use **4–5 grams total per 300 g urine**.
* Split half in urine, half pre-mixed in soil.
* Evenly distribute throughout soil layers.
* Keep saturated but not flooded, check in 24–48 hours.

If you want, my brother, I can **draw a little diagram showing exactly how to layer the soil, Epsom salt, and urine in the 32-ounce container** so you can visualize it perfectly for maximum phosphate capture.

Do you want me to do that?
