# Crystallizing Struvite to concentrate Phosphorous - a

My brother — yes! You can **pull phosphorus out of urine** at home by crystallizing **struvite** (magnesium-ammonium-phosphate, MgNH₄PO₄·6H₂O). It’s simple, low-tech, cheap (Epsom salt!), and it works even in tough conditions.

Below is a practical, field-ready guide + exact small-batch recipe for your 32-oz yogurt container, and a couple of scalable options if Epsom salt isn’t available.

# how urine → struvite works (why this is beautiful)

* **struvite formula:** MgNH₄PO₄·6H₂O
  each crystal locks **1 Mg**, **1 ammonium (N)**, and **1 phosphate (P)** together.
* **what urine provides:** plenty of ammonium (after urea hydrolyzes) and phosphate; **magnesium** is the limiting piece.
* **what we add:** **magnesium** (cheap: Epsom salt = MgSO₄·7H₂O) and **a little base** to raise pH so the crystals form.
* **fertilizer value:** struvite is a slow-release NP + Mg fertilizer. By weight it’s \~**12.6% P**, \~**5.7% N**, \~**9.9% Mg** (approx).

Typical **phosphorus in urine**: \~**0.5–1.0 g P per liter**.
That yields about **4–8 g of struvite per liter** (rule of thumb).

# small-batch recipe (32-oz / \~946 mL yogurt container)

## what you need

* fresh or 1–3-day stored urine: **\~0.95 L** (32 oz)
* **Epsom salt (MgSO₄·7H₂O):** **3.7–7.5 g** (see note below)
* a **base** to raise pH to \~**8.5–9.5**:

  * best: **washing soda (Na₂CO₃)** or **baking soda (NaHCO₃)**
  * workable: **hydrated lime** (Ca(OH)₂) — go slowly, it’s strong
* clean jar/bucket, spoon, coffee filter/cloth, pH paper if you have it
* optional: a second container to decant supernatant

> how much Epsom?
> you want **moles Mg ≈ moles P**. For household use, just add **\~4–8 g Epsom per liter**. For **0.95 L**, that’s **\~3.7–7.5 g**. Start with 5 g; you can add a pinch more later if needed.

## steps

1. **let urine convert (optional but helpful)**
   if it’s fresh, you can still proceed. If you store **1–3 days** loosely covered, natural enzymes convert urea → ammonium and the pH rises, which **helps** struvite formation.

2. **dissolve Epsom salt**
   sprinkle **\~5 g** Epsom into the **0.95 L** urine while stirring until dissolved.

3. **raise pH to 8.5–9.5**
   add **small pinches** of washing soda or baking soda, stir, and check with pH paper if available.

   * aim for **\~9**.
   * if you overshoot above \~10, crystals still form but you may co-precipitate other salts. No big deal, just try to be gentle.

4. **stir & wait**
   stir for **1–2 minutes**, then let it sit **30–60 minutes**. You should see a fine sandy/slushy precipitate (struvite).
   if nothing forms, add **another 1 g Epsom** and a **tiny pinch** of base, stir, wait again.

5. **settle & separate**
   let solids settle (an hour or overnight).
   pour off the clear/top liquid (save it — it’s rich in K and some N), and **filter the solids** through a coffee filter or cloth.

6. **rinse & dry**
   quickly rinse the cake with a splash of clean water, then **air-dry** it.
   store crystals dry in a labeled jar.

## expected yield (for \~0.95 L urine)

* if urine had **\~0.5–1.0 g P/L**, you’ll get roughly **3.8–7.5 g** of struvite.
* remember: that’s **slow-release P + N + Mg**. You can side-dress plants or blend into potting mixes.

> safety notes
>
> * ventilate (ammonia odor can appear).
> * **never** mix urine with bleach (toxic chloramines).
> * wear gloves if you have cuts. Urine is usually low-pathogen, but treat it with respect.
> * the **decanted liquid** (supernatant) is still valuable fertilizer (N, K). Dilute **1:10–1:20** before applying.

# fallback magnesium sources (if no Epsom salt)

* **“bittern”/concentrated seawater brine** (leftover from salt making) — rich in Mg²⁺.
* **magnesium chloride flakes** (sold as ice melt or de-icer in some regions).
* **milk of magnesia (Mg(OH)₂)** — provides Mg **and** alkalinity; add slowly while stirring.
* **dolomitic lime (CaMg(CO₃)₂)** — raises pH and supplies Mg, but it dissolves slowly; use as a slurry and give more time.
* **magnesium oxide (MgO)** — very reactive base; small amounts go a long way.

These all can drive struvite if you still hit **pH \~9** and provide enough Mg.

# alternative: precipitate **calcium phosphate** (no magnesium needed)

If Mg is scarce but you have **hydrated lime** (Ca(OH)₂) or wood-ash lye:

1. add **hydrated lime** (very small pinches) while stirring to raise pH to **\~10.5–11**.
2. **calcium phosphate** precipitates; settle, filter, rinse, dry.
3. This gives you a **P-rich** but Mg-free solid (slower, less elegant than struvite, but it works).

> wood-ash lye can substitute as base: leach ash with hot water, decant the alkaline liquor, and drip it in slowly while stirring. It raises pH but brings potassium; fine for agriculture.

# scaling up (rules you can memorize)

* **Epsom salt dose:** **\~4–8 g per liter of urine**.
* **Target pH:** **8.5–9.5** (struvite) or **10.5–11** (calcium phosphate).
* **Yield:** **\~4–8 g struvite per liter** (depending on P in urine).
* **Use:** side-dress a pinch per plant, or blend **\~1–3% by volume** into potting soil for slow-release.

### quick 5-gallon numbers (≈19 L)

* Epsom: **\~75–150 g total**
* Expected struvite: **\~75–150 g** (rough estimate)
* Add base gradually to pH \~9, stir, settle, filter.

# how to use the crystals

* **side-dress**: scratch a teaspoon into soil around a medium plant, water in.
* **mix**: add **1–3%** by volume to potting mixes.
* combine with your **nitrified urine tea** (for quicker N) and **wood ash** (for K) — but keep an eye on **pH** (ash raises it).

---

# troubleshooting

* **no crystals form:** add a bit more Epsom, bump pH slightly, stir and wait.
* **ammonia smell too strong:** you overshot pH; let it sit uncovered briefly outdoors so ammonia flashes off, then filter.
* **gelatinous goo:** normal if you have organic load; let it settle longer and filter through cloth.
* **too little yield:** your urine P was low; you can **batch multiple days** together before precipitating.

If you stock even a few kilos of **Epsom salt** and some **washing/baking soda** (or hydrated lime), you’ve built a portable, repeatable **phosphorus factory** that follows people wherever they go. Pair that with **bones → bone meal** when available, and you have both **slow multi-year P (bones)** and **steady daily P (struvite)**. That, my brother, is how a colony survives without Amazon or Walmart.
