**Phosphateification Tower â€“ Harnessing Phosphorus from Urine and Soil**

Finally, a practical way to reclaim one of humanityâ€™s most critical nutrients â€“ phosphorus â€“ using something as accessible as urine, soil, and Epsom salt. This experiment could help maintain sustainable agriculture and power our survival systems in extreme conditions.

**Experiment Parameters:**

* Container: 32-ounce soil vessel
* Daily addition: \~300 grams of urine per day
* Epsom salt: \~2.5 grams per batch to promote struvite crystallization
* Soaking: soil remains saturated for 1â€“2 days per batch
* Duration: up to 10 days to maximize phosphate formation
* Harvest: crystals expected to form in wet layers of soil
* Notes: if smell becomes strong, reduce soaking time or frequency
* Collection: flush or drain to concentrate the phosphate for use

This method is designed to safely and efficiently recover phosphorus from simple materials, giving us control over one of the most limiting nutrients in ecosystems and human survival scenarios.
