# Crystallizing Struvite to Concentrate Phosphorous - c

## Experiment: Struvite Crystallization in 32 oz Soil Tower

### Objective
The goal of this experiment is to concentrate phosphorus from urine using magnesium (Epsom salt) in a small-scale soil tower (32 oz). This allows us to maximize phosphorus availability while controlling nitrogen release, creating a high-efficiency phosphorus source for plants.

### Materials

- 32 oz soil container (yogurt bottle or equivalent)
- Well-drained soil (any garden or compost soil)
- Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Epsom salt)
- Urine (~300 grams per filling)
- Drill with 1/8 inch bit (to create drainage holes)
- Box or tray to contain overflow
- Protective gloves and mask (optional, for odor and hygiene)

---

### Setup Procedure

1. **Prepare the container**
   - Drill several 1/8 inch holes in the bottom for drainage.
   - Place the container in a box or tray to catch any leachate.

2. **Add soil**
   - Fill the container with soil, leaving ~0.5 inch from the top for liquid input.
   - Lightly compress soil to reduce large air pockets, but avoid over-compaction.

3. **Magnesium distribution**
   - For 32 oz soil (~300 grams urine volume target):
     - Add **2–2.5 grams of Epsom salt** throughout the soil.
     - Distribute evenly by gently mixing into the top 2/3 of the soil column.
     - Optionally, create a small layer of Epsom salt at the bottom as a slow-release reservoir.

4. **First urine application**
   - Slowly pour ~300 grams of fresh urine evenly over the soil surface.
   - Ensure that urine saturates the soil, creating a wet zone for crystal formation.

5. **Covering**
   - Optionally cover with a basket or ventilated lid to prevent insects while allowing airflow.
   - Avoid completely sealing; airflow reduces ammonia buildup.

### Timing and Harvest

- **Primary crystal formation:** Expected in **1–2 days**.
  - Crystals may form at the **interface of wet and slightly drier soil**, along the sides, or in saturated pockets.
- **Full 10-day process:** To maximize total phosphorus, allow the soil to remain wet for up to **10 days**, adding fresh urine each day if desired.
  - Note: Daily urine addition increases total struvite formation but also increases odor and handling risk.
- **Harvesting crystals:**
  - Small crystalline aggregates will appear throughout the wet zone.
  - Remove carefully by hand, or gently shake soil to collect from the bottom and sides.
  - Rinse briefly with minimal water if necessary, then dry in ambient conditions.

### Expected Yield

| Duration          | Estimated Struvite Formation | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| 1 day             | 0.03–0.1 grams             | Early formation, minor odor |
| 2 days            | 0.1–0.2 grams              | Significant crystals start to appear |
| 3–5 days          | 0.3–0.5 grams              | Majority of struvite forming |
| 10 days           | ~0.7–1.0 grams             | Maximum phosphorus capture, strong odor |

- Yields depend on **urine phosphorus content**, **magnesium availability**, and **soaking efficiency**.
- Crystals may vary in size and may not cover all soil surfaces uniformly.

---

### Optimization Notes

- **Saturation level:** Ensure soil is wet but not fully waterlogged for the entire 10 days to balance crystal formation and nitrogen stability.
- **Magnesium availability:** Uniform distribution is key; areas without magnesium will see little crystal formation.
- **Daily urine addition:** Optional, increases total phosphorus but also odor; careful handling recommended.
- **Harvest strategy:** Small daily harvests may help manage odor while maximizing phosphorus capture.

---

### Safety & Handling

- Crystals are generally safe for handling with gloves.
- Odor may become strong with extended soaking; cover partially for ventilation.
- Avoid prolonged direct contact with raw urine; use minimal handling and wash hands thoroughly.

### Summary

This 32 oz soil tower experiment provides a **small-scale, high-efficiency phosphorus source** via struvite crystallization. By carefully managing magnesium levels, urine input, and timing, we can produce concentrated phosphorus suitable for plant use, while also controlling nitrogen release in the soil. This experiment serves as a prototype for **future scalable phosphorus towers** for both experimental and survival applications.
