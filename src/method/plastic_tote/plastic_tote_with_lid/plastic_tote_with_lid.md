# Plastic Tote with lid

![001](textures/001.png)

With a plastic tote we have LOTS of space and the roots will sense it.

One option is to place one plant in the center by cutting a whole in the lid and letting the roots descend down.

But instead of filling the tote full of water, we just let the roots descend into a BOWL or GALLON JUG or other container that will contain the nutrient solution.

We are utilizing the tote for structure, space, and to keep light out, but not to hold the nutrient solution!

We are utilizing a system where we have many air roots. In this way, the plants must first start in a smaller container the will train the roots to grow at least 10" first. When the roots are 10" we can then hang them down into the system and the bottom of the roots will feed on the nutrient solution and the top part of the roots that are in the air will all be air roots.

By inserting a BOWL or GALLON JUG with nutrient solution we can easily change it out when it becomes dirty. This way the root are always happy.

We are not using a bubbler.
Instead we change the water in the bowl whenever it needs changing.
Since we are using free nutrient solution we can change the water as much as we need to without financial concern and because it is such a small amount of water it is very easy to do.
