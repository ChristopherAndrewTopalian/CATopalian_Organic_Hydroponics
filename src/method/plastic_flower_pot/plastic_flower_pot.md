# Plastic Flower Pot

![001](textures/001.png)  

With a 5 Gallon plastic flower pot we can make shift lid out of cardboard and we can easily put organic nutrient solution that we keep in a 1 gallon jug or other wide and deep container inside of the 5 Gallon flower pot.

We then place our plant on top of our flower pot cardboard cover hole or make shift cover that has a hole that allows the roots to descend.

---

The idea is that the flower pot gives the roots the impression that it is very spacious.

This will make many air roots.

On the bottom is our organic nutrient solution that can be in a bowl or any container that is wide and deep.

---

We start the plants first in a smaller container to train the roots to be about 10" before putting them in this 5 gallon flower pot system.

---

By utilizing the 1 Gallon of nutrient solution we make it easy to change out the nutrient solution with another 1 gallon container any time it is needed. This makes success far more likely with a clean system.
