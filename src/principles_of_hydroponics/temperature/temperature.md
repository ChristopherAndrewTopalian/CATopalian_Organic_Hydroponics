# Temperature

Keeping Temperature in the room under 85f is very important.

Right about at 85f is the max you would want the room to be, since the water will be around that temperature too!

The temperature being so warm means less oxygen in that water.

The plants REQUIRE a cool temperature for hydro to work efficiently!
