# CATopalian_Organic_Hydroponics
We make organic hydro easy. Check it out. I promise.

# Principles of Hydroponics
> 1. [Algae](src/principles_of_hydroponics/algae/algae.md)  
> You must block all light from hitting the nutrient solution or else Algae will destroy the roots fast!

> 2. [Temperature](src/principles_of_hydroponics/temperature/temperature.md)  
> The plants REQUIRE a cool temperature for hydro to work efficiently!

This is the CATopalian Organic Hydroponics System.

We do NOT need a bubbler.

We do NOT need 5 gallon buckets to hold water.

Instead we can use any bowl for containing the liquid and we keep the roots healthy by changing out the nutrient solution bowl as often as needed.

Because the bowl is white or clear we can see when the water is dirty and thus when it needs changing.

When the water is dirty we change the water quickly because it is a bowl system that is very small and easy to change out.
